# perspective

Looking for rapidcow/perspective?

This project is moved permanently to
[git.rapidcow.org/perspective](https://git.rapidcow.org/perspective/about/).
It is not abandoned, only that I have ceased to use
GitHub as a hosting platform.
This will be the SOLE commit in this repository.

Note: ignore https://github.com/TrellixVulnTeam/perspective_004Q
as it is an outdated version of my project I have since
rebased and changed from.  The pull request [was merged in][PR#5],
but it will become irrelevant upon the removal of big entries.
Really - just ignore everything there is on GitHub related to
my projects. If making this readme doesn't express my attitude
clearly enough, I don't know what will.

[PR#5]: https://git.rapidcow.org/perspective/commit/?id=976b62e015b14757754f706b0970cd84ebd4e7c8
